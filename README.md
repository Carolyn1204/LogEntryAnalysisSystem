# Log Entry Analysis System
Java / stack / quere / HashMap 

# Description
A Java application that efficiently processes and analyzes a dataset containing 1,000,000  log entries. Effective using of data structures to perform specific functionalities related to log data handling.

DataSet comprises 1,000,000 log entries. Each log entry is formatted consistently, providing structured data that can include timestamps, log levels, and messages.

# Core Functionalities:

• Log Reversal Display: Implement a functionality that allows users to view log entries in reverse chronological order. This is useful for examining the most recent events first.

• Real-time Log Queueing: Simulate the real-time processing of log entries as if they are being streamed live. Logs should be handled in the order they are received, maintaining the integrity of their sequence.

• Frequency Analysis of Log Entries: Analyze and display the frequency of occurrences for different types of log entries (e.g., based on log level or specific error messages).
